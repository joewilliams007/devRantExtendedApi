# devRantExtendedApi
Open-Source API Server created to add features on top of "official" devRant API. Intended for third-party clients and Web Extensions.

## Featuring: 

blocking users posts

a public chat

### Considering:

awards ? use own points to give out awards. the API will keep track of how many points you have used!

profiles ? steam - discord - ...

animated profiles for 3rd Party Clients ?

## Reasoning:

i would personal love those implementations and i will try to learn building web extensions in the meantime??

## Thoughts:

i know devRant is kind off ded but i think its a fun place and updates to it really wouldnt hurt!
